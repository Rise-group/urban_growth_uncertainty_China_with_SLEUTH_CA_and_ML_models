### Abstract 

With the availability of better computers, geographical information systems, and remote sensing data, urban growth modeling has become a viable tool for predicting the future spatial extent of cities around the world. This information allows policy makers, urban planners, environmental and civil organizations to make investments, design infrastructure, extend public utility networks, plan housing solutions, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. Despite its importance, most urban growth models do not highlight the importance of the spatiotemporal uncertainty in their prediction estimates. In this paper, we analyze the uncertainty in the urban land predictions by comparing the outcomes of two different growth models, one based on cellular automata known as the SLEUTH CA and a second one based on machine learning. We selected these two models because they are complimentary, one is based on human knowledge and pre-defined and understandable policies while the other one is purely data-driven and might be less influenced by any a priori bias. To test our methodology we chose Jiaxing and Lishui cities as they are representative of new town planning policies in China, and they have different spatial characteristics in tbueerms of land extension, geographical conditions, and economic growth drivers. We hope that this work can contribute to the planning, policy intervention, and urban development worldwide.
